# üïí ClockHack2313  
## ‚Äî Educational hack of a DIY clock kit based on ATtiny2313

**ClockHack2313** is an educational project that enables **cheap** and effective learning of AVR microcontrollers (specifically ATtiny2313), 7-segment display control, button input reading, sound generation, and timer usage.

I used this project to teach school students soldering and programming. Therefore, it had to be simple, inexpensive, and accessible for almost everyone.

<summary>The main challenge I faced</summary>

> While teaching the course, I encountered the problem of students having very different skill levels. The typical linear approach to learning (step-by-step progression with dependencies) simply didn‚Äôt work.
> 
> So I created conditions that work for a diverse group. More advanced students had time to solder the board, play with the simulation, and modify the code ‚Äî adding their own IO and interrupt logic. Others could focus on either just assembling the clock, or at least experimenting with the working simulation to see how it functions.

It‚Äôs a common soldering kit available on Amazon, AliExpress, etc. ‚Äî inexpensive and widely available.

The board is made of good quality PCB material (at least the ones I received), and even beginner students couldn't damage the traces. That‚Äôs crucial for learners who are just discovering how to solder.

It also uses a DIP socket for the microcontroller, which is much easier to solder than SMD chips.

The kit comes with a pre-programmed 89C2051 microcontroller that runs the clock firmware. It is inserted into a DIP-20 socket, so no soldering is needed. Some students stopped at this point and used it as a basic clock.

For further learning, I replaced this microcontroller with a pin-compatible **ATtiny2313**, which has a more modern architecture. (I believe this is a better starting point for serious AVR learning.)

Moreover, many **Arduino boards** are also based on the AVR architecture, making this knowledge transferable to more complex projects.

üí° **Important note:** the only hardware modification required is related to the reset pin. The RST pin on 89C2051 is active high, while ATtiny2313 uses an **inverted** reset signal. So a resistor must be moved from GND to VCC.

Located in the `firmware` folder, written using **AVRStudio** (older version) and compiled with **AVR-GCC**.

The code includes basic features: character output to the display, button interaction, contact debounce, buzzer beeping, and interrupt usage. These are fundamental exercises for working with microcontrollers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware and Components

- 4-digit **7-segment common cathode** display  
  (Anodes on PB0‚ÄìPB7, cathodes on PD0, PD1, PD2, PD6)
- 2 push buttons (PD4 and PD5)
- Buzzer with transistor (PD3)
- Microcontroller: **ATtiny2313** in DIP-20 (replacing 89C2051 from the original kit)
- Pull-up resistor on RST moved to **VCC** (due to reset polarity)
- PCB from a generic DIY clock kit

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Start

1. Get a DIY clock kit
2. Replace the 89C2051 chip with an **ATtiny2313**
3. **Move the pull-up resistor on the RST pin** from GND to VCC
4. Flash the `.hex` firmware using USBasp or any compatible programmer
5. Power up ‚Äî and watch the demo in action!

_Or_ ‚Äî simply open the `.dsn` file in **Proteus 8**, and run it without soldering anything!
