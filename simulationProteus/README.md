# 🧪 ClockHack2313 Simulation (Proteus)

This project contains a **Proteus** simulation file for testing the firmware on an **ATtiny2313** microcontroller without the need for real hardware.

## 🛠 How to Open

1. Launch **Proteus** (recommended version: **Proteus 8.9 Professional**).
2. Choose `File → Open Project...` or double-click the `ClockHack2313.pdsprj` file.
3. To start the simulation, press the ▶️ **Run Simulation** button.

## ✅ Tested

This simulation was created and tested in **Proteus 8.9 Professional**.  
It may not work correctly in other versions.

## 📄 Contents

- `ClockHack2313.pdsprj` — project file
- `.dsn` — schematic with ATtiny2313, 7-segment display, buzzer, and buttons
- `*.hex` — firmware compiled with AVR GCC and loaded into the microcontroller

> Note: Make sure the microcontroller in the schematic is configured to 1 MHz and the correct `.hex` file is attached.
